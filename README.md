## Tag-forrest
Tag your notes when they apply to different subsections, and auto update those sections when you make changes. (Try the example file)

Install: Copy everything to a folder in .vim/bundle
set conceallevel=1

Use: Press gy in normal mode to update a tag, with the cursor on it. Please see the sample notes file for formatting. You have to make your own hash for each unique note till I make a hash function. 

Tag coloumns are hidden by default. 
I use conceal for the tags and hash.
