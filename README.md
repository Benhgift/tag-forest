## Tag-forrest
Tag your notes when they apply to different subsections, and auto update those sections when you make changes. (Try the example file)

Install: 
  - clone everything to a folder in .vim/bundle
  - set conceallevel=1

Use: Press gy in normal mode to update a tag, with the cursor on it. Please see the sample notes file for formatting. You have to make your own hash for each unique note till I make a hash function. 

Tag coloumns are hidden by default. 
I use conceal for the tags and hash.

## To Do:
 * Make notes add automatically to sections if they don't already exist (IMPORTANTEST!)
 * Make notes auto remove from a section if you delete a tag
 * Make the process automatic without pressing gy

## Long Term Goal:
  Make a spaced repitition program that links in with this to provide targeted review. (only gives your notes on astro physics if it's given you the parent topic notes first for instance)
